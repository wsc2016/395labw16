# 395labw16

This is README files.  Every repository should have a README file so that people who are looking at
it have some idea of what the purpose of the repository is.  

The README.md file is automatically displayed by github when someone views the repo.

The .md extension means the file is formatted with Markdown which is a plain-text markup format

Markdown
--------

Markdown is handy for creating headers and other text emphasis like **bold**, *italics* and even
- bulleted
- lists
- of
- important
- things

The purpose of this repository is to help students learn how to use github to collaborate
